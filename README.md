## 🧾 SQL Queries Used

```sql
-- Top 5 Products by Sales
SELECT product, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Monthly Sales Trend
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(sales)
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;

-- Total Sales
SELECT SUM(sales) FROM sales_data;

-- High Value Transactions
SELECT *
FROM sales_data
WHERE sales > 1000;
```
